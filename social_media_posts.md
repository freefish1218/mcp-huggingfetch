## Reddit Post (r/LocalLLaMA, r/MachineLearning)

**Title**: [Tool] mcp-huggingfetch - Download HuggingFace models 3-5x faster with MCP integration

**Body**:

Hey everyone! I wanted to share a tool I've been working on that significantly speeds up HuggingFace model downloads.

## What is it?

mcp-huggingfetch is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides high-speed downloading of HuggingFace models directly through AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and VS Code.

## Key Features:

- **3-5x faster downloads** - Uses concurrent streaming and optimized chunk sizes
- **Automatic resume** - Network interrupted? No problem, it picks up where it left off
- **Smart filtering** - Download only the files you need (by type, size, or pattern)
- **Zero Python dependencies** - Pure Node.js implementation
- **Real-time progress** - See exactly what's downloading and how fast

## Performance Examples:

- ChatTTS (~2GB): 6 minutes vs 20 minutes traditional
- Whisper Large v3 (~1.5GB): 4 minutes vs 15 minutes traditional

## How to use:

1. Install via npm or use npx directly
2. Add to your MCP config (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code)
3. Just ask: "Download the ChatTTS model to ./models"

## Links:

- GitHub: https://github.com/freefish1218/mcp-huggingfetch
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-huggingfetch

Would love to hear your feedback and use cases!
